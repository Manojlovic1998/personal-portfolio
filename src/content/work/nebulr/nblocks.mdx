As a full-stack software engineer at Nebulr, I've worked on several technologies
and products, including the groundbreaking Nblocks. Nblocks is an innovative product
that is based on code reusability, interoperability, and orthogonal design of code.
With a frontend plugin, backend plugin, and multiple API microservices, users have
many feature sets to choose from, making application development processes with Nblocks
faster while reducing costs and time.

To begin using Nblocks, users must register with the platform and create their application with a CLI tool. After registration, they receive a unique identifier for each application, and default configurations can be tailored to fit their business plan. By installing Nblocks plugins, application owners can access various features and customization options. The [Nblocks documentation](https://nebulr-group.github.io/nblocks-docs/) provides comprehensive information on setting up Nblocks.

Nblocks offers a range of solutions, including a built-in system for user management and authentication. Additionally, Nblocks has an integrated role-based access control (RBAC) system. The RBAC system is highly customizable, allowing application owners to modify role names and associated grants to restrict access to specific resources, API endpoints, and frontend views.

Nblocks provides another solution, which is subscription-based integration with Stripe. Application owners can set up a payment wall in minutes by creating pricing plans in the application's configuration file, and Nblocks handles the rest.

Nblocks also has a fully customizable branding option, allowing application owners to match the look and feel of Nblocks components and pages to their current branding colors and user experience.

As the company continues to grow, Nblocks is continuously evolving, and new features and use cases are regularly added. To keep up with the latest features and integration, check out the Nblocks documentation website.
